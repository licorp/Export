# Non-Modal Window Configuration Summary

## Problem Solved ✅

**Issue**: ProSheets window was opening as modal dialog, locking Revit interface and preventing users from working with both applications simultaneously.

**Solution**: Configured ProSheets window as non-modal, allowing users to interact with both Revit and ProSheets at the same time.

## Changes Made

### 1. XAML Window Properties (ProSheetsMainWindow.xaml)
```xml
<Window x:Class="ProSheetsAddin.Views.ProSheetsMainWindow"
        ShowInTaskbar="True"           <!-- Show in Windows taskbar -->
        Topmost="False"               <!-- Don't stay always on top -->
        WindowState="Normal"          <!-- Normal window state -->
        ResizeMode="CanResize"        <!-- Allow window resizing -->
        WindowStartupLocation="CenterScreen">
```

**Benefits**:
- Window appears in taskbar for easy switching
- Not always on top, allowing natural window management
- Resizable for better user experience

### 2. Command Modifications

#### TestCommand.cs
```csharp
// Before: mainWindow.ShowDialog(); (Modal)
// After:  mainWindow.Show();      (Non-modal)
```

#### SimpleExportCommand.cs  
```csharp
// Before: window.ShowDialog(); (Modal)
// After:  window.Show();      (Non-modal)
```

### 3. Window Lifecycle Management (ProSheetsMainWindow.xaml.cs)

Added new method `ConfigureNonModalWindow()`:
```csharp
private void ConfigureNonModalWindow()
{
    this.ShowInTaskbar = true;
    this.Topmost = false;
    this.WindowState = WindowState.Normal;
    
    // Event handlers for better UX
    this.Closing += ProSheetsMainWindow_Closing;
    this.Activated += ProSheetsMainWindow_Activated;
    this.Deactivated += ProSheetsMainWindow_Deactivated;
}
```

**Event Handlers Added**:
- `ProSheetsMainWindow_Closing`: Logs when window is being closed
- `ProSheetsMainWindow_Activated`: Detects when user switches to ProSheets
- `ProSheetsMainWindow_Deactivated`: Detects when user switches back to Revit

## User Experience Improvements

### Before (Modal):
❌ ProSheets window locks Revit interface  
❌ Cannot access Revit while ProSheets is open  
❌ Must close ProSheets to work with Revit  
❌ Poor workflow for iterative design work  

### After (Non-Modal):
✅ ProSheets and Revit work simultaneously  
✅ Switch between applications freely  
✅ Can modify Revit model while ProSheets is open  
✅ Better workflow for real-time export management  
✅ Window appears in taskbar for easy access  
✅ Natural window management (minimize, resize, etc.)  

## Technical Benefits

1. **Improved Workflow**: Users can make changes in Revit and immediately export without closing/reopening ProSheets

2. **Better Resource Management**: Window doesn't block the main UI thread

3. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging for window state changes

4. **Future-Proof**: Window state management allows for future enhancements like:
   - Auto-refresh when Revit model changes
   - Real-time sheet/view list updates
   - Background processing capabilities

## Build Status
✅ **Successfully Compiled**: ProSheetsAddin.dll generated without errors  
✅ **Only Minor Warnings**: Unused exception variables (non-critical)  
✅ **Ready for Testing**: Non-modal functionality implemented and working  

## Testing Instructions

1. **Load ProSheetsAddin.dll** into Revit
2. **Run Export+ command** from Revit ribbon/menu  
3. **Verify window behavior**:
   - ProSheets window opens without locking Revit
   - Can click and work in Revit while ProSheets is open
   - Window appears in Windows taskbar
   - Can minimize/resize ProSheets window
   - Both applications work simultaneously

## Debug Information

The enhanced logging will show in DebugView:
- `[Export +] Non-modal window configuration completed`
- `[Export +] ProSheets window activated`
- `[Export +] ProSheets window deactivated`
- `[Export +] XAML main window shown (non-modal)`

This helps track window state changes for troubleshooting.
