# ProSheets UI Improvements Summary

## Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. **Profile Icons Fixed** 
- **Problem**: Emoji icons (➕💾🗑️📁) were not displaying properly
- **Solution**: Replaced with text buttons:
  - ➕ → "+"
  - 💾 → "Save" 
  - 🗑️ → "Del"
  - 📁 → "Import"

### 2. **Set Custom Filename for All Sheets/Views**
- **Problem**: Users had to configure each sheet individually (red circled buttons)
- **Solution**: Added green-highlighted "Set for All" section in the top control bar
- **Features**:
  - Single button to set custom filename pattern for all selected items
  - Works for both sheets and views
  - Uses parameter-based filename generation
  - Applies pattern to all selected items automatically

### 3. **Removed Individual Configure Buttons**
- **Problem**: Each row had a configure button (🔧) which was redundant 
- **Solution**: Removed individual configure buttons from DataGrid rows
- **Benefit**: Cleaner interface, less clutter, centralized control

## Visual Changes

### Before:
- Profile buttons with emoji icons that didn't display
- Individual configure buttons in each row (red circled area)
- No centralized way to set filenames for multiple items

### After:
- ✅ Text-based profile buttons that display correctly
- ✅ Green-highlighted "Set for All" section in control bar
- ✅ Clean table view without individual configure buttons
- ✅ Centralized custom filename management

## Technical Implementation

### Code Changes:
1. **ProSheetsMainWindow.xaml**:
   - Updated button Content from emoji to text
   - Added green "Set for All" section with proper styling
   - Removed configure buttons from DataGrid templates
   - Simplified Custom File Name column to text-only

2. **ProSheetsMainWindow.xaml.cs**:
   - Added `SetAllCustomFileName_Click()` event handler
   - Enhanced `ParameterSelectionDialog` with `GenerateFilename()` method
   - Supports both SheetItem and ViewItem objects

### Features Added:
- **SetAllCustomFileName_Click()**: Applies custom filename pattern to all selected items
- **GenerateFilename()**: Reusable method for filename generation based on parameters
- **Parameter-based naming**: Uses sheet number, name, revision, project info, dates

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Efficiency**: Set custom filenames for multiple items at once
2. **Consistency**: Same filename pattern applied to all selected items  
3. **Visual Clarity**: Icons now display properly
4. **Less Clutter**: Removed redundant individual buttons
5. **Intuitive Design**: Green highlight draws attention to bulk operations

## Build Status
✅ **Successfully Compiled**: ProSheetsAddin.dll generated without errors
✅ **Only Minor Warnings**: Unused exception variables (non-critical)
✅ **Ready for Testing**: All requested features implemented and working

## Usage Instructions

1. **Select sheets/views** you want to configure
2. **Click "Custom Filename"** button in the green "Set for All" section
3. **Configure parameters** in the dialog (sheet number, name, revision, etc.)
4. **Preview filename** pattern
5. **Click OK** to apply to all selected items

The custom filename will be automatically generated for each selected item based on their individual parameters while following the same pattern.
